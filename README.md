# Proxy Equalizer

This is a practical framework motivated by the paper "Avoiding discrimination
through causal reasoning". In particular we focus on the notion of removing
_proxy discrimination_.

Here we explore ways how proxy discrimination could potentially be removed in
practice, given a causal graph and observational data from that graph.
